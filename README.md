[DEPRECATED] This extension is deprecated. [Cart](https://github.com/extcode/cart "Github Repository of Cart") is the successor of wt_cart and supports TYPO3 6.2 or later.

wt_cart is a small but powerful extension which "solely" adds a shopping cart
to your TYPO3 installation.
The extension neither allows you to create products, articles or categories
nor includes a checkout functionality. The extension depends on powermail
which helps you to integrate the checkout process. Furthermore powermail is
utilized for sending the order confirmation.
