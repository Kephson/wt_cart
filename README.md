wt_cart 4.0.0 for TYPO3 7.6 LTS - only for upgrading from TYPO3 6.2.x

Works only with Powermail 2.0 and higher.

If you really need wt_cart for TYPO3 7.6 LTS for a faster update from 
TYPO3 6.2.x you could use this version of wt_cart.

[DEPRECATED] This extension is deprecated. For new projects please use 
[Cart](https://github.com/extcode/cart "Github Repository of Cart") instead of wt_cart.

wt_cart is a small but powerful extension which "solely" adds a shopping cart
to your TYPO3 installation.
The extension neither allows you to create products, articles or categories
nor includes a checkout functionality. The extension depends on powermail
which helps you to integrate the checkout process. Furthermore powermail is
utilized for sending the order confirmation.
